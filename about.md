  <h1>Hello, I'm Anant Srivastava ðŸ‘‹</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a curious and passionate, individual who is trying to bridge the world of technology, economics, and innovation. 
  </p>

  <p>
    With a background in computer science and software development, I've spent over six years creating robust solutions, but my heart has always gravitated toward the fascinating complexities of macroeconomics. I'm driven by curiosityâ€”whether it's exploring the latest AI research, designing machine learning models, or dissecting derivates and the math behind their greeks, it gives me immense pleasure in cutting throght the chaos and seeing patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm particularly intrigued by how markets behave, leveraging my technical background to build analytical tools that decode options chains, gamma walls, and open interest clusters. This synthesis of software engineering, data analysis, and economic intuition guides my day-to-day exploration and trading.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond screens and numbers, I'm a lifelong learner, aspiring philosopher, and an outdoor enthusiast excited about introducing the joy of hiking to my young child. My thirties have inspired deeper reflection and growth, shaping my philosophy toward intentional living, resilience, and constant self-improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feel free to reach out, collaborate, or chat about markets, code, philosophy, or hiking trails. I'm always happy to connect.
